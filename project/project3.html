  <p>
    Main event at GOA is Hackathon where students from groups go in wildlife or in a building together. There are many events that can happen like Kahoots, push-up challenges, and lectures. It lasts for the whole day, but you can leave whenever you want. There are also many opportunities to get a higher rank and start earning money on your own. Also, there is a test at the 100th lesson which I'm trying to qualify for now.
